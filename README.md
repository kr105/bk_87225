Custom firmware for this chinese doorbell

![device picture](device.jpg?raw=true)

Labeled as:
- 83225EPC-WIFI
- Video Intercom Camera

It has a very good hardware configuration and good enough build quality, but it comes with Tuya firmware so ðŸ¤®.

#### For now I have implemented :
- Access to the raw H264 stream coming from the device camera.
- Access to the raw PCM audio coming from the microphone.
- Support for GPIO events (currently only the "call" button is implemented).
- Send MQTT notifications to a broker when the "call" button is pressed.

#### Missing features:
- Speakers.
- RFID/NFC reader.
- Touch keyboard.
- Electronic door-lock connection.

This repo is not meant as a public release usable project, at least not yet. At some point in the future, I will upload proper flashing instructions and add customization and other features. For now, you can use it as a reference or anything else (MIT Licensed).
